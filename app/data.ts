export const about: string = `I am a Biomedical  Engineering graduate from National University of Singapore (NUS). My passion for programming began when I was exposed to the world of programming through my modules. Through these modules, I discovered that I enjoyed creating innovative solutions that have real-world impact. My internship with Venture Corporation Ltd served to test my knowledge of programming and imbued me with knowledge of technologies involved in a collaborative environment, such as Git. I joined 42 Singapore as a student shortly after graduation to further my skills in an environment that fosters collaboration, continuous learning and creative thinking.

Whether it's building sleek and responsive interfaces, or developing robust backend systems, I am excited by the oppportunity to work on projects that have a meaningful impact on the world. My goal is to collaborate with like-minded individuals, learn from others, and to contribute to innovative projects that bridge the gap between technology and real-world applications.`;
